# Compare multiple tools
comparison = analyzer.compare_tools([1, 2, 3], comparison_type='detailed')

print(f"Comparison Results: {comparison}")
```

## 📊 Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

The system processes data from:
- **Tool Database**: Current tool information and features
- **Version History**: Historical changes and updates
- **Market Data**: Pricing, adoption, and competitive intelligence
- **Quality Metrics**: Data quality scores and confidence levels

### 2. Competitive Metrics Calculation

```python
# Multi-dimensional scoring calculation
def _calculate_overall_score(self, metrics: CompetitiveMetrics) -> float:
    return (
        metrics.feature_score * self.scoring_weights['feature_score'] +
        metrics.popularity_score * self.scoring_weights['popularity_score'] +
        metrics.innovation_score * self.scoring_weights['innovation_score'] +
        metrics.maturity_score * self.scoring_weights['maturity_score']
    )
```

### 3. Market Positioning Analysis

```python
# Market position determination
def _determine_market_position(self, feature_score: float, popularity_score: float) -> MarketPosition:
    if feature_score > 75 and popularity_score > 75:
        return MarketPosition.LEADER
    elif feature_score > 75 and popularity_score > 50:
        return MarketPosition.CHALLENGER
    # Additional logic for other positions...
```

### 4. Trend Detection and Analysis

```python
# Statistical trend analysis
def _analyze_adoption_trend(self, feature: str, timeline: List[TrendPoint], trend_type: TrendType) -> Optional[TrendAnalysis]:
    correlation, p_value, slope, intercept = self._linear_regression(x_values, values)
    
    if p_value > self.trend_config['significance_threshold']:
        return None  # Not statistically significant
    
    direction = self._determine_trend_direction(slope)
    strength = min(abs(correlation), 1.0)
    velocity = slope
    
    return TrendAnalysis(...)
```

## 🔄 Maintenance and Optimization

### Database Optimization

Regular maintenance tasks:

```sql
-- Index optimization for competitive queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tools_competitive_score ON tools(competitive_score DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tool_versions_detected_at ON tool_versions(detected_at DESC);

-- Clean old analysis results (keep last 90 days)
DELETE FROM competitive_analyses WHERE analysis_date < datetime('now', '-90 days');
```

### Performance Tuning

For large datasets:

1. **Batch Processing**: Process categories in batches
2. **Caching**: Cache frequent analysis results
3. **Parallel Processing**: Use multiprocessing for independent analyses
4. **Data Pruning**: Focus on high-quality, recent data

### Quality Assurance

Regular quality checks:

```python
# Validate analysis results
def validate_analysis_quality(report):
    assert report.confidence_level >= 0.7
    assert len(report.market_leaders) > 0
    assert all(0 <= score <= 100 for score in report.competitive_scores)
    return True
```
